    "### Below code is to create overlapping tiles so that more images can be generated from the limited training dataset given. This will modify the training images only (only the images with annotations, so dataset 1 and 2, or wsi images # 1,2,3,4). This is necessary because when training any model, boundary effects will be inevitable, and by creating overlapping tiles around all four quadrants of the edge of the image, the model sees the object at least one time where it is not at the edge of the image. Below are the steps to create overlapping tiles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Let there be one image (size 512 by 512 in this case).\n",
    "2. Find all four 256 by 256 quadrants of the image.\n",
    "3. Let that quadrant be opposite of the new overlapping tile generated (opposite meaning top-left quadrant of original image will be bottom-right quadrant of new overlapping image and vice versa for all other three)\n",
    "4. Repeat # 1~3 for all images.\n"
